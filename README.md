# AltDetection
In-game alt account (using a heat system) detection for Roblox Luau, uses multiple adaptive techniques that will give returning hackers a hard time! Banning, kicking, warning, adding webhooks etc must be implemented manually.
# Features
- ⚙ Highly configurable!
- 👀 Adaptive!

# 🔧 Built-in techniques
- Account age
- Number of friends
- If they followed a friend into the game or not
- Voice chat bypass

# ⭐ Roadmap
- Bacon hair avatars (sorry 😔) (hide-able... I think?)
- Dictionary "regex" type search in their username to see if there are actual words in their username
- Frequency of firing remote events
- No about section in their user
- No favorite games (because [Cracked Combat](https://www.roblox.com/games/9087033497) must be there)
- Not in a group
- No paid Roblox cosmetics or gamepasses
